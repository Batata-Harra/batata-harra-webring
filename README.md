# Batata Harra Webring

## What's a Webring?
A webring is an element on the website that:

1. Signifies this site is part of a webring.
2. Allows you to move to the next or previous site of the webring.
3. Site owners donâ€™t have to do much. They just plop it on their site and a functional webring UI is there.

## Setup Instructions
Here are the instructions on how to join our awesome webring:

1. Clone this repo and add webringComponent.js to your project.
2. Add our webring component in the footer of your website `<webring-css site="https://gabykaram.com"></webring-css>`. 
3. Create a pull request to manifest.json with your own configuration.

Hurray! you're now a proud Batata Harra member.
