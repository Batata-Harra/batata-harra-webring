# Batata Harra Webring

## What's a Webring?
A webring is an element on the website that:

1. Signifies this site is part of a webring.
2. Allows you to move to the next or previous site of the webring.
3. Site owners donâ€™t have to do much. They just plop it on their site and a functional webring UI is there.
